
Machine Learning (ML) is a core branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on creating systems capable of 
automatically learning and improving from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms analyze 
large volumes of data to uncover patterns, make predictions, and support intelligent decision-making processes. 

The field of Machine Learning encompasses several learning paradigms such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, 
and reinforcement learning. Its applications are vast and transformative â€” powering recommendation engines, predictive 
analytics, autonomous systems, natural language processing, and image recognition. 

Python plays a pivotal role in the Machine Learning ecosystem due to its simplicity and rich set of libraries 
like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. These tools provide developers and researchers 
with efficient frameworks to build, train, and deploy robust machine learning models across diverse domains.
