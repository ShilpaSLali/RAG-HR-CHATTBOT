It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms 
such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. 
Its extensive standard library, combined with a vast ecosystem of third-party packages, allows developers to perform 
tasks ranging from web development and automation to data analysis and artificial intelligence. 

Python’s clean syntax and dynamic typing make it beginner-friendly, while its scalability and integration capabilities 
make it powerful enough for complex enterprise applications. The language’s active global community continues to enhance 
its features and tools, ensuring Python remains one of the most widely used and trusted programming languages in the world.
